#### By **{Francis Karanja Ngigi.}**
## Description
{The AkanNameGenerator takes in the users birthday and their gender to assign an Akan name. Giving Akan names is a popular cultural practice in Ghana. The Akan names are given depending on the day of the week you were born and you gender. Male Akan names are different from female Akan names, despite being born on the same day. Each name corresponds to a day of the week. This application takes in the users date of birth and gender as inputs, then it calculates the day of the week the user was born, and depending on the gender, returns a corresponding Akan name. }
